# Snake - HTML game
### Tribute to old school Nokia 3310 game
HTML canvas game in TypeScript (no third-party libraries)?<br>
Why not :)

Ok, almost no libraries...
The only two third-party library are RxJS (in order to improve the readability of the game flow) and reflect-metadata to allow dependency injection.

Enjoy playing :)
